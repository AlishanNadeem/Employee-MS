The inspiration for my application came from a real-world use case — managing employees and administrative data through a modern dashboard interface. Since I had already developed the Employee Management System using the MERN stack, I saw this as an opportunity to modularize it and showcase microservices architecture using Docker.
The main challenge I faced was running multiple services without Docker Compose. 
Manually creating networks, assigning ports, handling volumes for MongoDB, and managing inter-container communication required a clear understanding of how Docker networking works. Debugging container logs and resolving port binding conflicts also helped strengthen my troubleshooting skills.
Docker’s features significantly improved my development and deployment process. 
Creating separate containers for the frontend, backend, and database allowed me to isolate concerns and test components independently. Docker volumes ensured that MongoDB data persisted across restarts. I used Docker health checks in the backend service to monitor API availability — a feature crucial for production environments. 
Additionally, pushing images to Docker Hub simplified the portability of my application.
In a production environment, I would extend this setup by introducing Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration, secrets management, and auto-restart policies. I’d also implement a reverse proxy like Nginx to manage load balancing and SSL. This assignment gave me a hands-on understanding of deploying real-world applications using Docker and deepened my appreciation for containerization as a DevOps practice.
